# High North Maps

## A Mapping project by Simon & Vetle

This is an attempt at making up to date maps, intended for use in scientific publications and other uses. The maps are made by heavily relying on primary sources from the period. 

### Place localization process
*Places are generally located in the following way:*
1. Identify a place in the source material
2. Look up the placename in modern maps with modernized spelling
3. Look up the placename on historical maps.
4. Look up the placename in historical sources. (description of the place, and the order it appears in relative to other places)
5. Consult people familiar with the area & and historical period.
6. Consult the scientific literature.
7. Make a list of candidate places, taking the above points into consideration
8. Rule out places based on LIDAR maps, and archeological findings in the area.
9. Decide on a plausible place. Most places have only one plausible place, some have more places -- in these cases we defer to the place that seems to have had the most activity in the period, and with sorrounding toponymes roughly matching the historical place name. 

## Folder structure:

- Administrative_boundaries -- Geofiles concerning the the shape of administrative boundaries
- Administrative_places -- Geofiles concerning places used by the state
- Categorization -- Various geographical categorizations. incl. geofiles
- Data_files -- source material from the project, used to create these maps
- Height_data -- Height data files 
- Normalization_Mapping -- Normalization of historical names 
- Place_names -- Geofiles of place names
- Project_files -- qgis project files
- Routes -- geofiles of routes
- Terrain_features -- geofiles of terrain features, like ocean and rivers and so on. 

## We aim to create the following maps: 

*Variants of these maps will be made for different periods**

- Administrative boundaries (and how they change)
- Mapping estimated government control
- trade route map
- Mobility map
- Land usage maps
- Travel time map
- Population map 
- Historical placename map
- Normalized historical placename map
